## Introduction (10 seconds)
*[Face visible in camera]*

"Hi! I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to show you EmailCraft AI - an intelligent email writing assistant I built using Pydantic AI and Next.js."

## Problem Statement (10 seconds)

"We've all struggled with writer's block when composing professional emails. EmailCraft AI solves this by generating perfectly crafted emails based on your context and desired tone."

## Live Demo (30 seconds)
*[Screen share showing live application]*

"Let me show you how it works. Here's the live application at [your-url].vercel.app.

1. I'll enter what I want to say - let's say I need to follow up on a job application
2. Choose my tone - I'll go with 'professional'
3. Optionally add recipient name
4. Click 'Generate Email'

*[Wait for generation]*

And in just a few seconds, the AI has crafted a complete email with a subject line, body, and even gives me suggestions for improvement. I can copy this with one click and send it right away."
